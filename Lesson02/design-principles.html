        <h2>Visual Hierarchy</h2>
        <h3>The New York Times</h3>

        <p>
            The New York Times website effectively demonstrates the 
            principle of visual hierarchy. Headlines are prominently 
            displayed at the top, utilizing larger font sizes, bold 
            typography, and strategic placement to draw the viewer's 
            attention. This design element immediately communicates 
            the importance of news stories, guiding users to the 
            most relevant content.

        <h2>Hick's Law</h2>
        <h3>Apple</h3>
        <h4><a href="https://www.apple.com/"></a> https://www.apple.com/</h4>
        <img src="images/apple.jpg" alt="Apple Pic" />
        <p>
            Apple's website exemplifies Hick's Law by offering 
            a limited number of choices in its product lineup on 
            the mobile homepage. Users are presented with a focused
             selection of flagship products, reducing decision 
             fatigue. This streamlined approach simplifies the 
             decision-making process and encourages users to explore
              these key products further.

        <h2>White Space and Clean Design:</h2>
        <h3>The City of Mesa - Public Library</h3>

        <p>
            The Semplice website showcases clean design 
            and effective use of white space. The minimalist 
            approach ensures that there is ample white space
             around portfolio examples, which makes the content
              easy to focus on. Unnecessary clutter is removed,
               allowing the user to appreciate the showcased work
                without distractions. This design choice enhances
                 the user experience and emphasizes the quality 
                 of the portfolio.
