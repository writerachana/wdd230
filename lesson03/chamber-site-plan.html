      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Founded in 1925, Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) is 
        the leading and only National Chamber of Commerce 
        having headquarter in Kolkata, and one of the most 
        pro-active and forward-looking Chambers in the country today.
         Its membership spans some of the most prominent and major 
         industrial groups in India. ICCs forte is its ability to
          anticipate the needs of the future, respond to challenges, 
          and prepare the stakeholders in the economy to benefit from 
          these changes and opportunities. Set up by a group of pioneering 
          industrialists led by Mr G D Birla, the Indian Chamber of Commerce
           was closely associated with the Indian Freedom Movement,
            as the first organised voice of indigenous Indian Industry.
